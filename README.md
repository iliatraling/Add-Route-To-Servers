# Add-Route-To-Servers
These scripts are designed to add a route to several servers at once. 
For the AddRouteToServers script to work correctly, you first need to 
add the servers to the TrustedHosts list for PowerShell on your PC. 
This is done with the AddServersInTrustedHostsList script, then you 
run the main script; if your servers are already added to the list, 
you don't need to do this again.
